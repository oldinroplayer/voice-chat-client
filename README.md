## Features

- Proximity voice — hear nearby players automatically
- Push to Talk (PTT) / Open Mic mode
- Party / Guild / Room / Whisper channels
- Direct voice call to any character by name
- Per-player mute & volume control
- Mic & Speaker volume sliders
- Anti-tamper protection

---

## Layout

- `src/` — main DLL source and headers
- `vendor/` — third-party dependencies (ImGui, Opus, nlohmann/json)
- `dist/` — build output

---

## Configuration

Server IP is set in `src/voice_client.hpp`:

```cpp
std::wstring server_host_ = L"127.0.0.1";
INTERNET_PORT server_port_ = 7000;
```

Change `127.0.0.1` to your voice server IP before building.

---

## Memory Offsets

Only **ACCOUNT_ID** and **CHAR_ID** are read from client memory.
Position (X/Y/Map) is pushed by the map server via the voice server — no memory scanning needed for spatial audio.

Edit `src/memory_reader.hpp` to match your client version:

```cpp
// Client 2024-08-22
//constexpr uintptr_t ACCOUNT_ID = 0x116B7EC;
//constexpr uintptr_t CHAR_ID    = 0x116B7F0;

// Client 2025-07-16
constexpr uintptr_t ACCOUNT_ID = 0x011FB9A4;
constexpr uintptr_t CHAR_ID    = 0x011FB9A8;
```

Use [`tools/ro-mem-scanner.zip`](tools/ro-mem-scanner.zip) to find offsets for other client versions.

> Run as **Administrator** while logged into a character on a map.
